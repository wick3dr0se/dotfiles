<p>Catpussin themed i3, kitty, rofi & dunst configs with transparency, blur, active/inactive borders & more. Optionally the prompt & bashin framework can be installed - The latter enables many new commands as well as faster alternatives; The former provides a minimally beautiful BASH prompt. Both provide useful functions for avid linux users/scripters</p>
